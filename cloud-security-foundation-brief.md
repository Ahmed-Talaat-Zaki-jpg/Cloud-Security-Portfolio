# Cloud Security Foundation

This document outlines my understanding of cloud environments, identity management, and email security, mapping my hands-on IT experience to cloud security practices.

## 2. **Email Security & Domain Protection**

* **SPF: ** A DNS record that lists authorized mail servers for a domain to prevent unauthorized servers from spoofing emails.
* **DKIM: ** Adds a digital signature to emails, proving the message wasn't altered in transit.
* **DMARC: ** A policy that tells receiving servers how to handle emails failing SPF or DKIM checks (monitor, quarantine, or reject).
* **Investigation Tools: ** I use **WHOIS lookup** to check domain age and owner history, and **MX Toolbox** to verify DNS health and blacklists during phishing investigations.

## 3. **Cloud Architecture Basics**

* **Shared Responsibility Model: ** Cloud providers (Azure/AWS) secure the underlying physical infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for securing data, users, and configurations inside the cloud.
* **Configuration Management: ** Moving to the cloud requires strict controls to avoid accidental data leaks caused by misconfigured services.
